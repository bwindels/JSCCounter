# JSCCounter
Prototype how to have bi-directional communication between Javascript and Swift/Cocoa using JavascriptCore

Preview attempt was with an embedded invisible web view: https://github.com/bwindels/WKWebViewCounter, which had 3 processes and uses almost 60mb. This approach uses one process with about 23mb.
